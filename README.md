This Jupyter Notebook let users search in wich films both have been in. It is made in two sections
### *1. Internal code cells* 
Users’ needs to run this cells that imports the libraries and define functions required to perform the Star Wars API requests and search.
### *2. Users inputs and program output*
These cells interact with users. First the program ask the user name and then ask for the name of two characters, one by one.
`` 'Enter your first SW character name: '``
`` 'Enter your second SW character name: '``
If the name selected doesn’t match with any name in the character list, this message will rise:
``That is not a Star Wars character... Try again please!!!``
Users only have to run this cell again and input any right name
After input the names correctly, the program return the films names where both characters have been in.
Finally, there is a cell that shows the user a list of all the 87 characters to keep trying the search.

I hope you enjoy this Star Wars API search program!
